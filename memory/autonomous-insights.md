The system read the latest ingested data and summarized what matters for animal health.

## Data snapshot

| Type | Count |
|------|-------|
| Surveillance (CDC) | 19 |
| Literature (PubMed) | 15 |
| Cancer (animal / veterinary) | 16 |
| Case data (veterinary case reports) | 15 |
| Clinical (practice, small animal, equine) | 33 |
| Imaging & radiographs | 3 |
| Vet practice (guidelines, resources) | 6 |

## Active surveillance (conditions tracked)

- A Strain of Multidrug-Resistant &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; Newport
- Animal disease alerts
- Chikungunya
- Clade II Monkeypox
- Diphtheria
- East African Sleeping Sickness
- Extensively Drug-Resistant Typhoid Fever
- Global Dengue
- Global Measles
- Global Polio

## Consider (for animal health)

- **Surveillance:** Review new CDC travel notices for travel alerts and client advice (e.g. rabies, dengue, zoonotic).
- **Literature:** Review new one-health and animal papers for partnerships and research gaps.
- **Cancer:** Review new animal/veterinary oncology items for comparative oncology and collaboration.
- **Case data:** Review new veterinary case reports for emerging patterns or teaching material.
- **Clinical:** Use clinical/small animal/equine literature for protocols, differentials, and CE.
- **Imaging:** Use curated imaging datasets (TCIA, radiographs) for teaching or model development.
- **Vet practice:** Use AAHA/AVMA/VIN/Merck resources for guidelines and client handouts.

## Autonomous-Agent Topics

Clinical-adjacent topics inform veterinary care today. Research topics explore biology, mechanisms, and long-term discovery.

Each scheduled run finds literature (PubMed) for these topics. Results appear under **Literature** in the data (grouped by topic).

### Clinical-Adjacent

Topics that directly inform veterinary decision-making, interpretation, and care—without replacing clinical judgment.

- Early Detection of Disease Across Species
- Decoding Animal Pain and Distress
- Preclinical Disease States
- Unexplained Recovery and Resilience
- Microbiome–Behavior–Health Coupling
- Biological Timing and Treatment Response
- Non-Linear Dose and Response Effects
- Emergent Effects of Complex Care Pathways
- Silent or Masked Disease and Distress
- Unintended Consequences of Standard Care

### Research & Discovery

Topics where mechanisms are unclear, outcomes are surprising, and long-term autonomous exploration may lead to new biology, tools, or therapies.

- Unknown Biological Signals
- Latent Protective Mechanisms
- Pain Modulation Beyond Analgesics
- Hidden Costs of Normal Physiology
- Environmental Exposure and Sentinel Signals
- Species-Specific Health Advantages
- Comparative Physiology at Extremes
- Genetic Intervention and Biological Integrity
- Developmental Programming and Lifelong Health
- Unexpected Correlations and Anomalies

## For veterinary medicine (practice use)

- **In the clinic:** Surveillance = travel/zoonotic client advice; clinical + case_data = differentials and protocols; cancer = oncology consults; vet_practice = guidelines and client resources.
- **CE and teaching:** Literature, case reports, and clinical papers support continuing education and rounds.
- **Client handouts:** Use surveillance conditions and vet_practice links for client-facing materials.
