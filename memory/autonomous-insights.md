## Consider (for animal health)

- **Surveillance:** Review new CDC travel notices for travel alerts and client advice (e.g. rabies, dengue, zoonotic).
- **Literature:** Review new one-health and animal papers for partnerships and research gaps.
- **Cancer:** Review new animal/veterinary oncology items for comparative oncology and collaboration.
- **Case data:** Review new veterinary case reports for emerging patterns or teaching material.
- **Imaging:** Use curated imaging datasets (TCIA, radiographs) for teaching or model development.

*This file is updated automatically after each hourly ingest. The system does not yet send alerts or post elsewhere; that would be a next step.*
