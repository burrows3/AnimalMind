## Consider (for animal health)

- **Surveillance:** Review new CDC travel notices for travel alerts and client advice (e.g. rabies, dengue, zoonotic).
- **Literature:** Review new one-health and animal papers for partnerships and research gaps.
- **Cancer:** Review new animal/veterinary oncology items for comparative oncology and collaboration.
- **Case data:** Review new veterinary case reports for emerging patterns or teaching material.
- **Clinical:** Use clinical/small animal/equine literature for protocols, differentials, and CE.
- **Imaging:** Use curated imaging datasets (TCIA, radiographs) for teaching or model development.
- **Vet practice:** Use AAHA/AVMA/VIN/Merck resources for guidelines and client handouts.

## For veterinary medicine (practice use)

- **In the clinic:** Surveillance = travel/zoonotic client advice; clinical + case_data = differentials and protocols; cancer = oncology consults; vet_practice = guidelines and client resources.
- **CE and teaching:** Literature, case reports, and clinical papers support continuing education and rounds.
- **Client handouts:** Use surveillance conditions and vet_practice links for client-facing materials.
