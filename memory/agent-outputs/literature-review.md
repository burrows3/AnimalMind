## Reasoning by autonomous-agent topic

The agent reasons over ingested literature for each autonomous-agent topic (Clinical-Adjacent and Research & Discovery). Data from sources; reasoning from patterns and inferred gaps.

- **Early Detection of Disease Across Species** — 23 item(s). **Reasoning:** Prioritize validation of preclinical signals and early biomarkers for clinical use.
- **Decoding Animal Pain and Distress** — 21 item(s). **Reasoning:** Aggregate behavior, physiology, and biomarker studies to improve recognition in stoic species.
- **Preclinical Disease States** — 21 item(s). **Reasoning:** Prioritize validation of preclinical signals and early biomarkers for clinical use.
- **Unexplained Recovery and Resilience** — 13 item(s). **Reasoning:** Identify protective factors and care patterns from outlier recovery cases.
- **Microbiome–Behavior–Health Coupling** — 13 item(s). **Reasoning:** Map microbiome–behavior–health links for interventions and diet trials.
- **Biological Timing and Treatment Response** — 17 item(s). **Reasoning:** Use timing data to optimize anesthesia, vaccination, and treatment windows.
- **Non-Linear Dose and Response Effects** — 21 item(s). **Reasoning:** Document threshold and paradoxical responses for dosing guidelines.
- **Emergent Effects of Complex Care Pathways** — 13 item(s). **Reasoning:** Analyze combination effects beyond single interventions.
- **Silent or Masked Disease and Distress** — 8 item(s). **Reasoning:** Aggregate behavior, physiology, and biomarker studies to improve recognition in stoic species.
- **Unintended Consequences of Standard Care** — 13 item(s). **Reasoning:** Track long-term effects of common practices to refine guidelines.
- **Unknown Biological Signals** — 21 item(s). **Reasoning:** Explore uncharacterized signals and anomalies for new biology or biomarkers.
- **Latent Protective Mechanisms** — 22 item(s). **Reasoning:** Explore uncharacterized signals and anomalies for new biology or biomarkers.
- **Pain Modulation Beyond Analgesics** — 21 item(s). **Reasoning:** Aggregate behavior, physiology, and biomarker studies to improve recognition in stoic species.
- **Hidden Costs of Normal Physiology** — 22 item(s). **Reasoning:** Quantify cumulative cost of stress and inflammation for prevention.
- **Environmental Exposure and Sentinel Signals** — 8 item(s). **Reasoning:** Use animal sentinel data for environmental and human health early warning.
- **Species-Specific Health Advantages** — 16 item(s). **Reasoning:** Translate extreme physiology and adaptations into medical insights.
- **Comparative Physiology at Extremes** — 8 item(s). **Reasoning:** Translate extreme physiology and adaptations into medical insights.
- **Genetic Intervention and Biological Integrity** — 18 item(s). **Reasoning:** Integrate gene editing and early-life effects into health and welfare assessment.
- **Developmental Programming and Lifelong Health** — 8 item(s). **Reasoning:** Integrate gene editing and early-life effects into health and welfare assessment.
- **Unexpected Correlations and Anomalies** — 13 item(s). **Reasoning:** Explore uncharacterized signals and anomalies for new biology or biomarkers.
