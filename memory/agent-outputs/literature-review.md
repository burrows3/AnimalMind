## Reasoning by autonomous-agent topic

The agent reasons over ingested literature for each autonomous-agent topic (Clinical-Adjacent and Research & Discovery). Data from sources; reasoning from patterns and inferred gaps.

- **Early Detection of Disease Across Species** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Prioritize validation of preclinical signals and early biomarkers for clinical use.
- **Decoding Animal Pain and Distress** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Aggregate behavior, physiology, and biomarker studies to improve recognition in stoic species.
- **Preclinical Disease States** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Prioritize validation of preclinical signals and early biomarkers for clinical use.
- **Hidden Costs of Normal Physiology** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Quantify cumulative cost of stress and inflammation for prevention.
- **Genetic Intervention and Biological Integrity** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Integrate gene editing and early-life effects into health and welfare assessment.
- **Unexpected Correlations and Anomalies** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Explore uncharacterized signals and anomalies for new biology or biomarkers.

## Themes and gaps (for synthesizer)

### One-health / animal literature

- **one health animal** — 30 item(s). Use for partnerships, research gaps, or teaching.

### Animal / veterinary oncology

- **Canine cancer** — 1 item(s). Use for partnerships, research gaps, or teaching.
- **animal cancer** — 16 item(s). Use for partnerships, research gaps, or teaching.

### Veterinary case reports

- **case report** — 23 item(s). Use for partnerships, research gaps, or teaching.

## For other agents

- **Synthesizer:** Use "Reasoning by autonomous-agent topic" and themes above for opportunities.
- **Veterinary medicine:** Clinical + case_data + vet_practice support daily practice, guidelines, and client resources.
