## Reasoning by autonomous-agent topic

The agent reasons over ingested literature for each autonomous-agent topic (Clinical-Adjacent and Research & Discovery). Data from sources; reasoning from patterns and inferred gaps.

- **Early Detection of Disease Across Species** — 10 item(s). **Reasoning:** Prioritize validation of preclinical signals and early biomarkers for clinical use.
- **Decoding Animal Pain and Distress** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Aggregate behavior, physiology, and biomarker studies to improve recognition in stoic species.
- **Preclinical Disease States** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Prioritize validation of preclinical signals and early biomarkers for clinical use.
- **Unexplained Recovery and Resilience** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Identify protective factors and care patterns from outlier recovery cases.
- **Microbiome–Behavior–Health Coupling** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Map microbiome–behavior–health links for interventions and diet trials.
- **Biological Timing and Treatment Response** — 1 item(s). **Reasoning:** Use timing data to optimize anesthesia, vaccination, and treatment windows.
- **Latent Protective Mechanisms** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Explore uncharacterized signals and anomalies for new biology or biomarkers.
- **Hidden Costs of Normal Physiology** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Quantify cumulative cost of stress and inflammation for prevention.
- **Genetic Intervention and Biological Integrity** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Integrate gene editing and early-life effects into health and welfare assessment.
- **Unexpected Correlations and Anomalies** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Explore uncharacterized signals and anomalies for new biology or biomarkers.

## Themes and gaps (for synthesizer)

### One-health / animal literature

## For other agents

- **Synthesizer:** Use "Reasoning by autonomous-agent topic" and themes above for opportunities.
- **Veterinary medicine:** Clinical + case_data + vet_practice support daily practice, guidelines, and client resources.
