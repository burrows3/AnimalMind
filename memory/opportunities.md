## How this was built

Multiple agents run autonomously after each ingest:
1. **Surveillance reviewer** — reviews CDC/surveillance data.
2. **Literature reviewer** — reviews literature, cancer, case data.
3. **Synthesizer** (this agent) — reads their outputs and writes opportunities below.

## Opportunities (from agent thinking)

### From surveillance

**Conditions to watch (travel / zoonotic):**
- A Strain of Multidrug-Resistant &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; Newport — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Chikungunya — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Clade II Monkeypox — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Diphtheria — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- East African Sleeping Sickness — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Extensively Drug-Resistant Typhoid Fever — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Global Dengue — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Global Measles — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Global Polio — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Malaria — consider travel alerts or client advice.

**Opportunity:** Review new CDC notices and surface alerts for vets and one-health partners.

### From literature

- **Partnerships:** New one-health and cancer papers suggest collaboration and comparative oncology opportunities.
- **Research gaps:** Case reports and literature themes point to teaching material and emerging patterns.
- **Opportunity:** Summarize "new this period" for researchers and clinics.

### From system insights

- Surveillance: review new CDC travel notices for alerts.
- Literature: review new papers for partnerships and gaps.
- Cancer / case data / imaging: use for teaching, collaboration, or model development.

### For veterinary medicine (clinic use)

- **In the clinic:** Use surveillance for travel/zoonotic client advice; clinical + case_data for differentials, protocols, and CE; vet_practice (AAHA, AVMA, VIN, Merck) for guidelines and client handouts.
- **Opportunities:** New clinical/small animal/equine papers → protocols or rounds; new case reports → teaching or client materials; vet_practice links → client resources.

*Agents run on the same machine (or VM) after each ingest. Add more reviewers by adding scripts and having the synthesizer read them.*
