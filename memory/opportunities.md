## How this was built

Multiple agents run autonomously after each ingest:
1. **Surveillance reviewer** — reviews CDC/surveillance data.
2. **Literature reviewer** — reviews literature, cancer, case data.
3. **Synthesizer** (this agent) — reads their outputs and writes opportunities below.

## Opportunities (from agent thinking)

### From surveillance

**Conditions to watch (travel / zoonotic):**
- A Strain of Multidrug-Resistant &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; Newport — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Animal disease alerts — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Chikungunya — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Clade II Monkeypox — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Diphtheria — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- East African Sleeping Sickness — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Extensively Drug-Resistant Typhoid Fever — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Global Dengue — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Global Measles — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Global Polio — consider travel alerts or client advice.

**Opportunity:** Review new CDC notices and surface alerts for vets and one-health partners.

### From literature

- **Partnerships:** New one-health and cancer papers suggest collaboration and comparative oncology opportunities.
- **Research gaps:** Case reports and literature themes point to teaching material and emerging patterns.
- **Opportunity:** Summarize "new this period" for researchers and clinics.

### Reasoning by autonomous-agent topic

The literature reviewer reasons over ingested data for each autonomous-agent topic (Clinical-Adjacent and Research & Discovery). Inferred opportunities:

The agent reasons over ingested literature for each autonomous-agent topic (Clinical-Adjacent and Research & Discovery). Data from sources; reasoning from patterns and inferred gaps.
- **Early Detection of Disease Across Species** — 10 item(s). **Reasoning:** Prioritize validation of preclinical signals and early biomarkers for clinical use.
- **Decoding Animal Pain and Distress** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Aggregate behavior, physiology, and biomarker studies to improve recognition in stoic species.
- **Preclinical Disease States** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Prioritize validation of preclinical signals and early biomarkers for clinical use.
- **Unexplained Recovery and Resilience** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Identify protective factors and care patterns from outlier recovery cases.
- **Microbiome–Behavior–Health Coupling** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Map microbiome–behavior–health links for interventions and diet trials.
- **Biological Timing and Treatment Response** — 1 item(s). **Reasoning:** Use timing data to optimize anesthesia, vaccination, and treatment windows.
- **Latent Protective Mechanisms** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Explore uncharacterized signals and anomalies for new biology or biomarkers.
- **Hidden Costs of Normal Physiology** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Quantify cumulative cost of stress and inflammation for prevention.
- **Genetic Intervention and Biological Integrity** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Integrate gene editing and early-life effects into health and welfare assessment.
- **Unexpected Correlations and Anomalies** — 5 item(s). **Reasoning:** Explore uncharacterized signals and anomalies for new biology or biomarkers.


### From system insights

- Surveillance: review new CDC travel notices for alerts.
- Literature: review new papers for partnerships and gaps.
- Cancer / case data / imaging: use for teaching, collaboration, or model development.

### For veterinary medicine (clinic use)

- **In the clinic:** Use surveillance for travel/zoonotic client advice; clinical + case_data for differentials, protocols, and CE; vet_practice (AAHA, AVMA, VIN, Merck) for guidelines and client handouts.
- **Opportunities:** New clinical/small animal/equine papers → protocols or rounds; new case reports → teaching or client materials; vet_practice links → client resources.

*Agents run on the same machine (or VM) after each ingest. Add more reviewers by adding scripts and having the synthesizer read them.*
