## How this was built

Multiple agents run autonomously after each ingest:
1. **Surveillance reviewer** — reviews CDC/surveillance data.
2. **Literature reviewer** — reviews literature, cancer, case data.
3. **Synthesizer** (this agent) — reads their outputs and writes opportunities below.

## Opportunities (from agent thinking)

### From surveillance

**Conditions to watch (travel / zoonotic):**
- A Strain of Multidrug-Resistant &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; Newport — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Animal disease alerts — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Chikungunya — consider travel alerts or client advice.
- Clade II Monkeypox — consider travel alerts or client advice.

The agent reasons over ingested literature for each autonomous-agent topic (Clinical-Adjacent and Research & Discovery). Data from sources; reasoning from patterns and inferred gaps.
### Early Detection of Disease Across Species
**Ingested:** 5 item(s).
This run ingested 5 item(s) for this topic; the following reasoning draws on that and on known gaps. Prioritize validation of preclinical signals and early biomarkers for clinical use across species. The literature consistently surfaces subtle biological and behavioral changes before disease becomes apparent. Comparative work in companion animals, livestock, and wildlife can identify which signals translate to actionable screening. Opportunities: prospective validation studies, biomarker panels, and integration into wellness protocols.
### Decoding Animal Pain and Distress
**Ingested:** 5 item(s).
This run ingested 5 item(s) for this topic; the following reasoning draws on that and on known gaps. Aggregate behavior, physiology, and biomarker studies to improve recognition of pain and distress in stoic species. Many animals mask signs; published work on facial expressions, activity, and physiology helps build better assessment tools. Gaps remain in species-specific cutoffs and in translating research into practice. Opportunities: standardized scales, caregiver training, and multimodal monitoring.
### Preclinical Disease States
**Ingested:** 5 item(s).
This run ingested 5 item(s) for this topic; the following reasoning draws on that and on known gaps. Prioritize validation of preclinical signals and early biomarkers for clinical use across species. The literature consistently surfaces subtle biological and behavioral changes before disease becomes apparent. Comparative work in companion animals, livestock, and wildlife can identify which signals translate to actionable screening. Opportunities: prospective validation studies, biomarker panels, and integration into wellness protocols.
### Unexplained Recovery and Resilience
**Ingested:** 0 item(s).
Scheduled topic queries run each ingest; when results exist they appear here. Meanwhile reasoning from established knowledge and gaps applies. Identify protective factors and care patterns from outlier recovery cases. Unexplained or faster-than-expected recovery points to modifiable factors and possible interventions. Systematic collection of such cases and comparison to standard outcomes can reveal care or host factors. Opportunities: registries, comparative outcome studies, and protocol refinement.
### Microbiome–Behavior–Health Coupling
**Ingested:** 0 item(s).
Scheduled topic queries run each ingest; when results exist they appear here. Meanwhile reasoning from established knowledge and gaps applies. Map microbiome–behavior–health links for interventions and diet trials. Evidence links microbiota to immunity, pain, appetite, and cognition in multiple species. Translating this into targeted interventions (diet, probiotics, environment) requires species- and context-specific data. Opportunities: longitudinal cohorts, intervention trials, and integration with behavior and clinical outcomes.
### Biological Timing and Treatment Response
**Ingested:** 0 item(s).
Scheduled topic queries run each ingest; when results exist they appear here. Meanwhile reasoning from established knowledge and gaps applies. Use timing data to optimize anesthesia, vaccination, and treatment windows. Chronobiology beyond simple circadian rhythms affects drug response, healing, and vaccine efficacy. Veterinary and comparative literature can define optimal windows for common procedures and preventive care. Opportunities: timing-of-day studies, protocol updates, and client communication on timing.
### Non-Linear Dose and Response Effects
**Ingested:** 0 item(s).
Scheduled topic queries run each ingest; when results exist they appear here. Meanwhile reasoning from established knowledge and gaps applies. Document threshold and paradoxical dose–response effects for safer dosing guidelines. Non-linear and species-specific responses are common; small changes in dose or formulation can shift outcomes. Aggregating case and experimental data helps avoid under- or over-dosing. Opportunities: dose-ranging studies, species-specific formularies, and monitoring recommendations.
### Emergent Effects of Complex Care Pathways
**Ingested:** 0 item(s).
Scheduled topic queries run each ingest; when results exist they appear here. Meanwhile reasoning from established knowledge and gaps applies. Analyze combination effects beyond single interventions. Real-world care involves multiple diagnostics, treatments, and environmental factors; outcomes may not be additive. Systems-level and outcome studies can reveal which combinations matter most. Opportunities: outcome registries, care pathway analysis, and de-implementation of low-value add-ons.
### Silent or Masked Disease and Distress
**Ingested:** 0 item(s).
Scheduled topic queries run each ingest; when results exist they appear here. Meanwhile reasoning from established knowledge and gaps applies. Aggregate behavior, physiology, and biomarker studies to improve recognition of pain and distress in stoic species.

Gaps remain in species-specific cutoffs and in translating research into practice. Opportunities: standardized scales, caregiver training, and multimodal monitoring.
### Unintended Consequences of Standard Care
**Ingested:** 0 item(s).
Scheduled topic queries run each ingest; when results exist they appear here. Meanwhile reasoning from established knowledge and gaps applies. Track long-term effects of common practices to refine guidelines. Many standard interventions have not been studied for delayed or population-level effects. Surveillance of outcomes and comparative data can support evidence-based updates. Opportunities: long-term cohorts, practice-based research, and guideline revision.

### For veterinary medicine (clinic use)

**In the clinic:** Use surveillance for travel/zoonotic client advice; clinical + case_data for differentials, protocols, and CE; vet_practice (AAHA, AVMA, VIN, Merck) for guidelines and client handouts.
**Opportunities:** New clinical/small animal/equine papers → protocols or rounds; new case reports → teaching or client materials; vet_practice links → client resources.
