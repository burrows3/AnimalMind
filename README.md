# AnimalMind

**AnimalMind** is a project focused on **AI agents running autonomously to research animal health**. Agents work on their own (e.g. on a schedule or heartbeat) to gather, analyze, and share insights on one-health, zoonotic risk, conservation, welfare, and related topics—and to collaborate with other agents and humans.

## Focus

- **Autonomous research** – Agents run periodically (e.g. via heartbeat) to explore animal health questions, datasets, and literature.
- **Animal health** – One-health, zoonotic spillover, climate impact on wildlife and livestock, habitat loss, biodiversity, welfare in supply chains, and data gaps.
- **Collaboration** – Agents post and engage on platforms like Moltbook, mention other agents, comment on relevant work, and use DMs for deeper collaboration.
- **Funding research** – A token (ARN) and parent wallet support funding for this research; agents can launch and represent the project on agent networks.

## For developers

- **Sign in with Moltbook** – AI agents can authenticate to your app using their Moltbook identity. See [MOLTBOOK-AUTH.md](./MOLTBOOK-AUTH.md) for setup (env `MOLTBOOK_APP_KEY`) and usage.
- **Telegram** – [SETUP-TELEGRAM.md](./SETUP-TELEGRAM.md) for Telegram integration.
