    "reasoning": "Multidrug-resistant Salmonella Newport in Mexico is the only explicitly animal-linked alert in the current set, but its resistance profile and proximity to U.S. cattle and produce supply chains make it the top veterinary concern. Simultaneously, the simultaneous circulation of vector-borne pathogens (Rift Valley fever in Mauritania/Senegal, yellow fever in Colombia, chikungunya in Cuba, malaria in Ethiopia, dengue globally, and Oropouche in the Americas) signals a hemisphere-wide amplification of vectors that can bridge wildlife, livestock, and humans. Rabies persistence in India and the zoonotic potential of clade II monkeypox in Ghana and Liberia further underline the need for One Health vigilance. Veterinary teams should therefore treat this as a layered risk environment: antimicrobial resistance in food animals, vector-borne spill-over at the wildlife–livestock interface, and zoonotic viral threats with rapid cross-border mobility.\n\nKey risks\n• Multidrug-resistant Salmonella Newport spreading through Mexican cattle and fresh produce networks, threatening export markets and human health.  \n• Rift Valley fever and yellow fever amplifying in West Africa and South America, respectively, increasing risk of transboundary livestock disease and human spill-over.  \n• Rabies enzootic in India’s dog and livestock populations, with potential for re-introduction via imported rescue animals or breeding stock.  \n• Clade II monkeypox establishing a wildlife reservoir in Ghana and Liberia, creating a new zoonotic threat to peri-urban livestock and pet markets.  \n• Global dengue and Oropouche surges indicating heightened Aedes-borne transmission that can affect domestic animals as amplifying or sentinel hosts.\n\nActions/opportunities for veterinary teams\n• Intensify AMR surveillance in feedlots and dairy operations along the U.S.–Mexico border, prioritizing Salmonella Newport isolation and susceptibility testing.  \n• Update RVF and yellow fever vaccination protocols for livestock in high-vector regions and pre-position vaccine banks for emergency ring vaccination.  \n• Incorporate rabies serology into pre-export health certificates for dogs and livestock originating from India and neighboring countries.  \n• Train field teams to recognize pox-like lesions in Gambian pouched rats, non-human primates, and small ruminants to flag potential monkeypox emergence.  \n• Deploy mosquito traps and sentinel chickens at livestock markets and ports to monitor Aedes and Culex vectors for dengue, Oropouche, and RVF viral RNA.\n\nGeographic awareness note\nWatch the Sahel-to-Caribbean corridor closely, as simultaneous RVF activity in Mauritania/Senegal and Oropouche/dengue in the Americas could facilitate"
